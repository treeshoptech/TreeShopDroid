**Android Port of TreeShop - Map-First Business Operations for Tree Care Professionals**

## Overview

TreeShopDroid is the Android version of TreeShop, bringing the revolutionary map-first business operations platform to Android devices. Based on the iOS app architecture, TreeShopDroid delivers the same powerful workflow management with native Android performance.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **In Active Development**

This repository contains:
- âœ… **Development Mind Map PWA** - Visual planning tool for tracking Android development
- ðŸ”„ **Android App** - Coming soon

## Quick Start

### Access the Development Planner

The visual mind map for planning and tracking development:

```bash
cd planner
# Open index.html in your browser
```

Or use a simple HTTP server:

```bash
cd planner
python -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

### Import Initial Roadmap

1. Open the planner in your browser
2. Click the import button (ðŸ“¥)
3. Select `initial-roadmap.json`
4. View the complete TreeShopDroid development roadmap

## What is TreeShop?

TreeShop is a map-first business operations platform that treats geography as the primary data structure. Unlike traditional directory-based apps, TreeShop positions the map as the interface where every tree, job, and customer exists first as a location.

**The Differentiator:** When you drive past a property where you've worked, TreeShop shows you. When you tap a parcel, you see every tree scored, every job completed, every dollar earned - all in one card.

## Core Features (Planned)

### 4-Stage Workflow
- **LEAD** (Blue) â†’ New leads coming in
- **PROPOSAL** (Orange) â†’ Proposals sent to customers
- **WORK_ORDER** (Green) â†’ Active jobs in progress
- **INVOICE** (Red) â†’ Jobs completed, payment pending
- **COMPLETED** (Gray) â†’ Fully completed and paid

### Map-First Interface
- User location tracking and auto-zoom
- Address search with autocomplete
- Custom workflow-colored markers
- Tap markers for lead details
- Google Maps integration

### Offline-First Architecture
- Room database for local persistence
- Works in no-signal environments
- Automatic sync when online
- WorkManager for background tasks

## Based on TreeShop iOS

This Android app is a port of the successful iOS TreeShop app. Key reference points:

- **TreeShop iOS Repository**: [github.com/treeshoptech/TreeShop](https://github.com/treeshoptech/TreeShop)
- **Data Models**: LEAD.swift with 50+ fields
- **Workflow System**: WORKFLOW_MANAGER.swift
- **UI Design**: Dark mode native design
- **Architecture**: SwiftData persistence, MapKit integration

## Development Workflow

1. **Plan in Mind Map**: Use the visual planner to break down features
2. **Track Progress**: Update node status as you work
3. **Store Details**: Keep implementation notes in each node
4. **Export Regularly**: Backup your planning data

## Getting Involved

This is an internal TreeShop Tech project. Development progress is tracked in the mind map planner.

### Development Tips

- Start with the planner to understand the full scope
- Reference the iOS app for feature parity
- Follow Android best practices
- Maintain offline-first architecture
- Test on multiple device sizes
